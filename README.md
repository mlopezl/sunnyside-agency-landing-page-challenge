# Frontend Mentor – Sunnyside Agency Landing Page Solution

This is my solution to the **Sunnyside Agency Landing Page** challenge on Frontend Mentor. The project focuses on building a modern, responsive landing page for a creative agency, closely matching the provided design while following clean, maintainable, and scalable frontend practices.

This challenge was a great opportunity to practice responsive layouts, CSS Grid and Flexbox, UI state management, and vanilla JavaScript interactions.

## Overview
This project is a responsive agency landing page that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. It features a full-width hero section, service highlights, testimonials, an image gallery, and a footer with social links.

The page includes a mobile-friendly navigation menu controlled via a hamburger icon, smooth UI state changes, and responsive images optimized for different screen sizes.

The goal was to closely replicate the original Frontend Mentor design while keeping the code semantic, organized, and easy to maintain.

## The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.
- Experience a fully responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Open and close the mobile navigation menu using a hamburger icon.
- Close the mobile menu by clicking outside of it.
- See hover states for interactive elements such as buttons, links, and social icons.
- Navigate a layout that closely matches the original Sunnyside design.

## My process
- Structured the page using **semantic HTML5** elements such as `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, and `footer`.
- Built the main layout using **CSS Grid** for large content sections and **Flexbox** for navigation and component alignment.
- Implemented **responsive design** with multiple breakpoints to ensure a smooth experience across devices.
- Used **CSS custom properties (variables)** to manage colors and maintain visual consistency.
- Followed the **BEM methodology** for class naming to keep the CSS scalable and easy to maintain.
- Created a responsive navigation menu with **vanilla JavaScript**, controlling UI states through CSS classes.
- Implemented a “click outside to close” pattern for better mobile UX.
- Managed desktop and mobile images separately to optimize layout and visual fidelity.
- Added hover and active states to improve usability and interactivity.
